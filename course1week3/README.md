# One hidden layer neural network

## Usage

Just run `main.py`, you can train from scratch or train with  load pre-trained weights following the annotation in `main.py`

## Introduction

- The hidden laryer have three nerve cell using activation fuction `tanh` and output layer use activation function `sigmoid`
